# TechSectorStockPricePrediction-Django
 Tech(Sector) Stock Price Prediction: ---------------------------- The project aims to predict the stock prices of large technology companies using time series analysis and machine learning algorithms. The main objective is to develop LSTM and ensemble models to accurately predict the stock prices of five major tech companies - Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Tesla. The model is trained using S&P 500 and NASDAQ datasets to improve forecasting accuracy.  LSTM and the proposed ensemble model combine various regression algorithms such as Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, SVR, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost. The model is trained on historical stock price data from the top five tech companies, and the features are normalized and pre-processed to remove any noise or outliers. The model is tested as the root mean squared error RMSE metric to measure the accuracy of predictions.  The project aims to provide investors with a reliable and accurate valuation tool for industrial companies, which can help inform their investment decisions. A web-based application developed with Django allows users to enter a stock symbol, and the application returns the forecasted stock price for the next day. The project can potentially revolutionize the financial industry by providing investors with a powerful and accurate fund valuation tool.
